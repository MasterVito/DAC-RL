You are given the following mathematical problem:

{REPLACE}

Your task is NOT to solve the problem. Instead, break it down into **more than 3 subproblems** that, if solved, would naturally lead to the solution of the original problem.

Please follow this output format strictly. Use the tags <SUBPROBLEM x> and </SUBPROBLEM x> as shown, and ensure that you provide more than 3 subproblems:

<SUBPROBLEM 1>
<first subproblem>
</SUBPROBLEM 1>

<SUBPROBLEM 2>
<second subproblem>
</SUBPROBLEM 2>

<SUBPROBLEM 3>
<third subproblem>
</SUBPROBLEM 3>

<SUBPROBLEM 4>
<fourth subproblem, if needed>
</SUBPROBLEM 4>

<SUBPROBLEM 5>
<fifth subproblem, if needed>
</SUBPROBLEM 5>

...

Do not provide any explanations or answers. Only list the subproblems using the tags `<SUBPROBLEM x>` and `</SUBPROBLEM x>` as shown.
