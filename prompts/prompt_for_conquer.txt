You are given a challenging math problem and its decomposition into subproblems.

## Your task is to:

1. Solve the **subproblems sequentially** (in the given order).
2. Show detailed reasoning for each subproblem.
3. **Do not use `\\boxed{}` when solving subproblems.**
4. After solving all subproblems, combine their results to solve the **original problem**.
5. Present the final answer to the original problem **only once, enclosed in `\boxed{}`**.

## Input

**Original Problem:**
{Original}

**Subproblems:**

{Subproblems}

## Final Instruction

* First, go through the subproblems one by one with detailed reasoning.
* Finally, derive the answer to the **original problem** and present it in the format:

$$
\\boxed{\\text{final answer here}}
$$
